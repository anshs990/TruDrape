# TruDrape
Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026

TruDrape is a web-based virtual clothing try-on platform that uses machine learning and 3D rendering to simulate how garments drape on an individual’s true body shape. By estimating body proportions from user images and generating a parametric 3D avatar, TruDrape enables realistic and interactive try-on experiences directly in the browser.

The platform addresses a major challenge in online fashion retail—high return rates due to poor fit—by improving size confidence, reducing waste, and enhancing the online shopping experience. Built using Azure cloud services, TruDrape demonstrates how AI-powered body modeling can create more sustainable and accurate fashion ecommerce solutions.
